# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### [Scala with tapir and ZIO] codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://demo.realworld.io/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a backend application built with **[Scala with tapir and ZIO]** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[Scala with tapir and ZIO]** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

> Describe the general architecture of your app here [TODO]

# Getting started

If you don't have [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org) installed already, you can use the provided wrapper script:

```shell
./sbtx -h # shows an usage of a wrapper script
./sbtx compile # build the project
./sbtx test # run the tests
./sbtx run # run the application (Main)
```

For more details check the [sbtx usage](https://github.com/dwijnand/sbt-extras#sbt--h) page.

Otherwise, if sbt is already installed, you can use the standard commands:

```shell
sbt compile # build the project
sbt test # run the tests
sbt run # run the application (Main)
```
